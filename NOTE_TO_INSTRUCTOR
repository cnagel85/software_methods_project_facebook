Minor changes from the original project design:

Newsfeed only shows your posts and posts by your friends instead of all posts on your friends walls, which I believe is closer to how facebook actually works.

Additional Features:

    Like button:
        Each post has a like button for all users that can view it.
        Once liked, the post can be unliked.
        A total count of likes is kept for each post and placed next to the like button
        ujs handles the swap out of like to unlike without page reload

    Comments:
        a comments like with the number of comments next to it is available for each post
        when followed, the link takes you to a page that shows the micropost on the left
        and any comments as well as a comment form on the right

    Deletion:
        both posts can comments can be deleted by the user that created them


Other possibly useful info:
    this may no longer be a problem, as we are pretty sure it is fixed, after updating profile,
    the server doesn't redirect to the user edit page and cant find it.  if this happens,
    just go to the index, the updates to profile still save.
    we have only seen the bug a couple times and it hasn't been reproduced in a while

     current email and passwords for profiles on the live version of the app:

        corey@example.com    testing
        foobar@example.com   testing
        user1@example.com   testing
